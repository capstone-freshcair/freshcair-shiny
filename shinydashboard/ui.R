        California has an ambitious goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045,
        yet it persists in the production of oil and gas, driven by its historical
        legacy as a significant petroleum producer. Senate Bill (SB) 1137 is a key piece
        of legislation that aims to regulate oil and gas infrastructure and reduce emissions.
        
        A provision in the law mandates a 3,200 foot minimum distance for new oil and gas
        structures from sensitive areas such as residential areas, schools, and healthcare
        facilities. The law was signed, but the oil industry successfully lobbied to
        move it to a referendum vote in November 2024. Now, the fate of SB 1137 depends on
        public approval, but there is a lack of data-driven analysis of the impacts of the proposed rule to inform the vote."

             harmful air pollution, like oil wells, have increased harmful exposure to chemicals linked to fossil fuel activity and has in turn, led to premature deaths, reportings of asthma and 
             exacerbations of existing respiratory conditions, as well as preterm birth. Disadvantaged communities throughout the US continue to face the unequal distribution of the

                       Neighborhood oil has been proven to be harmful towards communities nearby because oil well operations rely on the use of harmful chemicals for

                   <p>The introduction of setbacks, specifically the 3,200-foot setback mandated by Senate Bill 1137, significantly influences the number of new oil wells predicted in California. Setbacks are regulatory distances that prevent the drilling of new oil wells near sensitive areas such as schools, hospitals, and residential communities. This policy aims to reduce the harmful health and environmental effects associated with oil and gas extraction, especially in disadvantaged communities.
<br><br>    To understand the impact of setbacks on new well predictions, the setback distances were incorporated into predictive models for well entry and exit. The setback effectively reduces the number of viable locations where new wells can be drilled. Consequently, this results in a decline in the number of new wells projected over time. By implementing the setback, the model forecasts fewer new wells because the restricted areas encompass significant portions of potential drilling sites. Note that the model assumes that wells are equally likely to be drilled at any point within an oil field.
<br><br>    Historical data and spatial analysis were examined to map out the regions affected by the setback distances. The analysis revealed that the 3,200-foot setback covers many areas previously available for drilling. By overlaying this spatial data with historical well locations, the impact of the setback on future drilling activities was simulated. The predictive models, adjusted to account for these new restrictions, consistently showed a decrease in the number of new wells over the forecast period from 2020 to 2045.
<br><br>    This reduction is particularly pronounced in urban and suburban regions where sensitive receptors are more densely located. The setback policy not only reduces the number of new wells but also has broader implications for environmental justice, as it helps to mitigate the adverse health impacts on communities living near oil extraction sites.

                   <p> Machine learning played a crucial role in enhancing the predictive accuracy of oil well operations and outcomes. Traditional methods, like Poisson regression, were initially used to estimate the number of new and exiting wells. However, 
                                          these methods have limitations, especially in capturing complex, nonlinear relationships in the data. 
                                          To overcome these limitations, machine learning models, specifically Random Forest regression,
                                          were developed to provide more robust predictions. 
                                          <br><br> <strong> Data Collection and Preparation: </strong> The models were trained on historical data from 1977 to 2019, which included features such as oil prices, capital expenditures (CapEx), operational expenditures (OpEx), depletion rates, and field-specific information. 
                                          The historical Brent oil prices were adjusted to present dollar terms to ensure consistency in the data. 
                                          <br><br> <strong> Model Selection: </strong> Random Forest regression was chosen due to its ability to handle complex interactions and nonlinearities in the data. 
                                          This ensemble learning method aggregates the predictions from multiple decision trees,
                                          reducing the risk of overfitting and improving generalization.
                                          <br><br> <strong> Model Training: </strong> The Random Forest model was trained with 500 trees and 4 randomly selected features at each split (mtry = 4).
                                          The training process involved using the historical data to learn patterns and relationships between 
                                          the input features and the target variable (number of new wells). The model's performance was evaluated using metrics
                                          like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which measures the average magnitude of the prediction errors.

The Random Forest model, which was trained with 500 trees and 4 randomly selected features at each split (mtry = 4), captures larger shifts and trends than the Poisson model, which is more conservative and does not fluctuate as much as the Random Forest. The ensemble nature of the Random Forest model allows it to capture complex nonlinear relationships between the predictor variables and the response, making it a powerful tool for modeling well entries. The Poisson model provides more conservative estimates, reflecting its tendency to predict fewer new wells overall, and often underestimated the peaks seen in the true data. This comparison highlights the strengths

The production for the Random Forest model is slightly lower after about 2028 because it predicts fewer new wells starting around this time, and also more well exits over the entire forecasted period. This suggests that the Random Forest model may be more sensitive to changes in the input features over time, capturing the combined effect of reduced new well development and increased well abandonment on total production. The Poisson model, on the other hand, shows a more gradual decline in production, likely due to its more conservative estimates of new well entries and exits. The impact of the 3,200 foot setback is more pronounced in the Random Forest model, as the gap between the two scenarios is larger compared to the Poisson model.

                     <p>The figure illustrates the projected impact of a 3,200 foot setback policy on Californiaâs oil production compared to a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. 
                     The setback line demonstrates the policyâs increasing effectiveness over time due to its cumulative effect on reducing the number of new wells drilled each year.
                     As fewer new wells are added annually under the setback scenario, the overall oil production decreases more significantly with each passing year compared to the BAU scenario.
                     This compounding effect highlights the long-term benefits of implementing a setback policy, as the reduction in new well drilling will lead to a decrease in oil production over 
                     the course of the forecasted period of 2020 to 2045. By visualizing these trajectories, policymakers and stakeholders can better understand the potential of setback policies to reduce 
                     oil production.
