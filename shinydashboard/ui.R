        California has an ambitious goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045,
        yet it persists in the production of oil and gas, driven by its historical
        legacy as a significant petroleum producer. Senate Bill (SB) 1137 is a key piece
        of legislation that aims to regulate oil and gas infrastructure and reduce emissions.
        
        A provision in the law mandates a 3,200 foot minimum distance for new oil and gas
        structures from sensitive areas such as residential areas, schools, and healthcare
        facilities. The law was signed, but the oil industry successfully lobbied to
        move it to a referendum vote in November 2024. Now, the fate of SB 1137 depends on
        public approval, but there is a lack of data-driven analysis of the impacts of the proposed rule to inform the vote."

             again that pollution and public health hazards have disproportionately affected Black, Brown, indigenous, and poor communities (Donaghy 2023). Stationary sources of
             harmful air pollution, like oil wells, have increased harmful exposure to chemicals linked to fossil fuel activity and has in turn, led to premature deaths, reportings of asthma and 
             exacerbations of existing respiratory conditions, as well as preterm birth. Disadvantaged communities throughout the US continue to face the unequal distribution of the 
             harmful effects associated with well activity. This is what is known as <strong>fossil fuel racism</strong>, the disproportionate effects  of 
             climate change, fossil fuel extraction, transportation, processing, and consumption on Black, Brown, Indigenous and poor populations.
                       Neighborhood oil has been proven to be harmful towards communities nearby because oil well operations rely on the use of harmful chemicals for
                       oil extraction. They release harmful chemicals like Volatile Organic Compounds, rely on hundreds of chemicals to extract fossil fuels and maintain well
                       sites, including many known to cause hormone disruption, reproductive and developmental harm, as well as increase one's risk to cancer. A study in Science Advances

An <strong> active </strong> well is an oil well with continuous oil extraction. Whereas a non-active oil well includes wells that have not been extracting oil for more than six months.

                                        defined as a community with an annual median household income less than 80% of the state's annual median household income. <br><br>In 2012,  the US Environmental Protection
                                        Agency revised the nation's air quality standards in which the annual PM 2.5 exposure is <strong> 12 micrograms per cubic meter (Âµg/m3)</strong>. <br><br>Although non-active wells are currently not producing any oil, its existence still carries an impact on its surroundings They can leak oil, gas, and other toxic chemicals into surrounding air, soil or groundwater (Cox III et al. 2023). Non active wells pose as a threat to surrounding air and water quality as they remain open holes left unattended. <strong> Orphaned wells </strong>, wells that are no longer producing and have no owner, pose serious environmental risks as they can leak oil and other pollutants, causing air and water contamination if left unsealed.</div>
