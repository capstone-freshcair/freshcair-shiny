                                    California has an ambitious goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045,
                                    yet it persists in the production of oil and gas, driven by its historical 
                                    legacy as a significant petroleum producer. Senate Bill (SB) 1137 is a key piece
                                    of legislation that aims to regulate oil and gas infrastructure and reduce emissions.
                                    A provision in the law mandates a 3,200 foot minimum distance for new oil and gas
                                    structures from sensitive areas such as residential areas, schools, and healthcare 
                                    facilities. The law was signed, but the oil industry successfully lobbied to
                                    move it to a referendum vote in November 2024. Now, the fate of SB 1137 depends on
                                    public approval, but there is a lack of data-driven analysis of the impacts of the proposed rule to inform the vote."))),
